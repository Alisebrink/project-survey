# Survey form with React

This app has been made with React by Linnea Isebrink.
It's a short survey for a free concert ticket giveaway. 

## The problem

To make this applikation I used HTML, CSS and React. For me it felt kind of easy once I got the hang of how to use React. I really like coding with components and using state. This project was really fun to do!
